The Natural Rights of Man are a recognition that a Man’s life is an end in itself, that he is fit to live in reality, that as a rational animal his means of survival is his mind, that to live amongst other men he must be free to act according to reason for the maintenance and furtherance of his life, that his freedom to act to ensure his life by rational means imposes no obligations on others except a negative one; to not restrict that freedom.

Property is a consequence of the primary right of Life. Life is a constant process of self-generated and self-sustaining action and there can be no action without a thing that acts and upon which that action is performed. To deprive a man of ownership of his physical form would be to deprive him of ownership of his life. To deprive a man of the things which he alone has acted upon and transformed would be to deprive him of the products of his life. Just as a man’s cells act on physical matter to sustain and build his body, his mind acts on a macroscopic level to sustain and build his life. It is true, literally and figuratively that to deprive a man of the products of his life and mind, on a microscopic or macroscopic level, is to deprive him of life itself. 

The values a Man gains by living among others when these Rights are protected is immeasurable. He does not have to live in fear of his life and does not have to treat men as predators and threats; this allows mind thus freed from the constant task of defense from physical destruction the freedom to pursue acts of production and creation. He does not have to fear that the physical products of his life will be taken from him by force; this allows his level of production and accumulation to become extended beyond the few assets a lone man is capable of protecting in his presence and he is freed to create beyond the scale of his own hands and lifespan. The protection of these Rights (from without and within) and the preservation of the blessings of that free society is the only righteous purpose for which governments can be constructed.

The greatest accomplishments ever made by America were done in fidelity to these values enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the greatest evils she has sank to were in accordance to a system of values diametrically opposed to these. These evils which we rebuke on fundamental moral and ethical grounds are as follows:


- The levying of an income tax.
- The institution of a fiat currency and the outlawing of the ownership of gold and silver.
- The creation of non-objective laws in the form of supposed anti-monopoly laws.
- The infringement by the government on the citizens natural right to keep and bear ams in protection of their lives and property from both mobs of people and from the government itself.
- The institution of a public school system and the creation of a standard of education which all private schools must follow by threat of force.
- The institution of every program that functions by force with the aim of redistributing property from some to others including social security, medicare, and every form of corporate welfare.
- The waging of foreign wars which are not in the interest of the defense of American Liberties and Security.
- The maintenance of a large and expensive military in times of peace which acts an unpaid security force for the members of NATO and the rest of the world as well.
- The expropriation of the wealth of American citizens in service of foreign people and foreign powers.
- The creation of a national debt that couldn’t be paid in the lifetimes of the borrowers and the continued efforts to expand that debt to enslave preceding generations to its service.


These many usurpations all stem from the United States’ government forgetting its proper function, forgetting its duty to protect the rights of its citizenry and becoming instead a consistent destroyer of rights and a great enemy of Liberty. These past failures and aggressions against the sensibilities of a free people, atrocious as they may be, are not reason enough for a dissolution of the relationship between Texas and the Federal government. As long as there remains a process for the resolving of these legislative issues through a legal and civilized means it would be the height of folly to break away from a fruitful union our state has enjoyed for a large part (but not the entirety) of it’s existence. 

There are however certain rights and liberties afforded to the American people which Texas will not allow to be abrogated by any means and which will be resisted by the least force necessary to guarantee them. The implementation of any of these policies will be taken as unbearable provocation against the citizenry:

- National Firearm Registry.
- The banning of any firearm that is legal at the time of the writing.
- The disarmament of the Texas State Guard
- The banning of any mining or drilling technique which does not violate the rights of those involved.
- The banning of the use of fossil fuels
- The nationalization of any industry or business
- The passing of legislation that would take money from people that have never owned slaves and give it to people who have never been slaves for the purpose of “reparations”. Includes deficit spending
- The tampering with of Texas state elections by any other state or any member of any other state
- The packing of the supreme court by increasing its size.
	
A national registry of firearms or the outright banning of the ownership and use of firearms is too tempting an offering for a tyrant or a gathering of tyrants. Texas will show restraint in its protestations against the Federal and will not use physical force to achieve its ends but it will also not be disarmed. 

The use of one’s own property is a basic right which alone defends the right to use private property in any way one pleases so long as it does not cause objective and provable damage to the property and lives of others. This right includes the right to exchange one’s property or services for a value, thus any attempt to seize an industry or own any part of a profession will be denied within the borders of Texas. The use of force to deprive Texans of this right which is integral to our economy and production of goods and power will be taken as an attempt to enslave our people.

Our State’s system of representation is the very means by which we are attempting to peacefully resolve our issues. Should this system be tampered with by Federal interventions it will be taken as proof that words are not the means by which the Federal government wishes to deal with us, that it imagines itself to be a ruler of men, and that it would prefer to make us obedient by means other than our minds and reason. If it should be proven in a Texas court that this has occurred it will be taken as an intolerable provocation.
