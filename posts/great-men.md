### Purpose

I am making this list, to be elaborated in subsequent articles bearing the names of each man, to document those rare men who have fought Tyranny with a principled and virtuous dedication to Individual Rights and Liberty. This first batch we be thematically dedicated to those heros of Texas Independence and future releases will cover the Founding Fathers amoung others.I'll be using this knowledge to write an upcoming essay on the question of whether describing history in terms of it's Great men is valuable to understanding the factual occurances of the time. 

Regardless of their merit as a tool to describe history they undoubtably offer the living a greater value still: An object of Admiration and Inspiration. To those living in times such as ours, the story of the lives of these men offers sustanence beyond food and comfort beyond wine.

The story of Juan Seguin is more than the story of one man, his life and his values hightlight those of all of the men he lead into battle as well as the impecable fastitiousness of their characters. Furthermore, the story of Juan Sequin is strictly necessary for the proper understanding of the charachter of Texas as well as a proper understanding as to why it is such as singular Nation within another such singular nation.
